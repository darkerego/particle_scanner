# Particle Wallet Appraisal Tool

#### What? 

<p>
This is a POC token and native wallet balance enumerator. Rather than 
paying $50 per month to Quicknode, or Alchemy, you can simply use particle's 
multi chain RPC for free! Yes, truly free, and IME, it is truly unlimited.

Check out [particle](https://particle.networks) , they are awesome.  
</p>


#### Why?  

<p>

If you're anything like me and find that you have far too many assets. spread 
out across far too many chains, spread out across far too many wallets, because 
you like to drive a tractor, then you will understand why this code is 
so useful .

</p>


#### How? 

<p>
Particle's API allows you to specify a parameter with each request `chainId`, 
which takes the integer number of the chain that you want to query. And yes, 
I also wrote and included some web3 middlware so that you can start using 
this is all of your other web3 projects!
